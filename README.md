# PCT2075 Library

This repository contains the **PCT2075** library, which provides functions for interacting with the PCT2075 temperature sensor using the I2C protocol. The library is designed to be used with STM32 microcontrollers.

## Prerequisites

Before using this library, make sure you have the following:

- STM32 microcontroller with I2C peripheral support
- Development environment set up for STM32 (e.g., STM32CubeIDE)
- PCT2075 temperature sensor connected to your microcontroller via I2C

## Installation

To use the PCT2075 library in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the `pct2075.c` and `pct2075.h` files into your project folder.
3. Include the `pct2075.h` header file in your main application file.

## Usage

To use the PCT2075 library, follow the code example below:

```c
#include "pct2075.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    uint8_t i2c_status;
    PCT2075_typedef pct2075;
    ptr_pct2075_temperature temperature_value;
  
    // Configure the PCT2075 parameters
    pct2075.i2c_port = I2C1;
    pct2075.i2c_addrs = PCT2075_I2C_DEVICE_ADDRESS;
    pct2075.i2c_HAL_Master_TX = i2c_masterTransmit; // Replace with your STM32 HAL masterTransmit function
    pct2075.i2c_HAL_Master_RX = i2c_masterReceive;  // Replace with your STM32 HAL i2c_masterReceive function
  
    // Initialize the PCT2075 sensor
    PCT2075_init(&pct2075);
  
    // Read the temperature from the PCT2075 sensor
    i2c_status = PCT2075_get_temperature(&temperature_value);
  
    // Print the temperature and I2C status
    if(i2c_status == true) {
        printf("Ambient temperature: %fÂ°C, I2C status: %d\n\r", temperature_value, i2c_status);
    }
  
    // Rest of your code...
}
````

Make sure to replace the placeholder functions i2c_masterTransmit and i2c_masterReceive with the appropriate I2C functions from the STM32 HAL library.
